;;; The Class SINGLE-THREADED-INTERPRETER
;;; =====================================

;;; A single-threaded interpreter implements all operations that can
;;; be performed by a single thread, and calls its superordinate
;;; interpreter for operations that deal with threads.  This allows us
;;; to separate the semantics of the core language from the details of
;;; concurrent behavior and simplifies the implementation of various
;;; concurrent interpreters with different concurrency models.
